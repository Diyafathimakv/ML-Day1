            "enter the text Artificial Intelligence (AI) is developing and advancing right before our very eyes. It has aggressively integrated into our society as it contributes heavily to a plethora of fields such as medical, legal, military, and government. Although AI is used universally as a resource and tool, it is less certain how advanced and dependable it will become. Likewise, society is still determining the implications it will have on the global dynamic.   Diplomatic figures and institutes have utilized AI to enhance productivity and facilitate international development and diplomatic efforts. Diplomats who have served in various regions of the world have shared with ADST their views of AI in the workplace, the global sphere, and what the future could look like. This “Moment in U.S. Diplomatic History” will explore various diplomatic perspectives on AI over the time of its development and includes excerpts from the following ADST oral histories: Leslie Gerson (2007), a career consular officer, discusses how she wished she had more technological knowledge when she went to Sandia Labs since it would have aided in her understanding of AI; Keith Curtis (2018), who was acting senior commercial officer for a number of years, shares his viewpoint on how the future is not in AI but in aerospace; Richard Virden (2011), a National War College faculty member, discusses how AI contributes heavily to the military and the military-industrial-complex and questions if Congress is making the right decisions in allocating large amounts of money to combative efforts rather than countering cyberwarfare; and Jack Shellenberger (1990), the former director of programs at Voice of America, who remarks on the international development of AI in the context of political and trade relationships.\n"
